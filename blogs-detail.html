                  <h2>Learning at Home</h2>

                  <div class="blog-post-body">
                    Our homes are powerful places for living and learning. As we move through the daily and weekly
                    rhythms of home, we discover a panoply of learning moments for our young children. These moments are
                    not tied to a curriculum, not focused on standards or expectations. They happen naturally,
                    organically, as our children follow their innate instincts to explore the important tools of their
                    culture with curiosity and enthusiasm.
                    <p>
                      Boston College psychology professor, Dr. Peter Gray, writes in his book,&nbsp; <em>Free To
                        Learn</em>: &ldquo;Children are biologically predisposed to take charge of their own education. When
                      they are provided with the freedom and means to pursue their own interests, in safe settings, they
                      bloom and develop along diverse and unpredictable paths, and they acquire the skills and
                      confidence required to meet life&rsquo;s challenges.&rdquo;[1]
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether your children are still toddlers and preschoolers, or if you have decided to
                      homeschool, there are many ways that you can create at home the conditions that ignite natural
                      learning. By reimagining the ordinary spaces of our homes as extraordinary resources for early
                      childhood learning, we can foster a home learning environment that sparks curiosity, engages
                      children naturally in discovery of their world, and cultivates a more peaceful home life.</p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Here are 10 simple ideas for re-envisioning your home as a powerful place for
                        natural learning:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Freedom</h2>
                    <p>You are a facilitator of freedom, a protector of the conditions of natural childhood
                      learning. You simply listen, and watch, and then you help to gather or find resources that help
                      your child to learn naturally as he is innately designed to do. You bridge the gap between your
                      child&rsquo;s nascent interests and ideas and the vast world around him.</p>
                    <p>
                      As pioneering early childhood educator, John Holt, wrote in his classic book,&nbsp; <em>Teach
                        Your Own</em>: &ldquo;What children need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more
                      of the real world; plenty of time and space to think over their experiences, and to use fantasy
                      and play to make meaning out of them; and advice, road maps, guidebooks, to make it easier for
                      them to get where they want to go (not where we think they ought to go), and to find out what they
                      want to find out.&rdquo;[2]
                    </p>
                    <p>As a parent, you protect this freedom&mdash;the time and space for natural learning&mdash;and
                      connect your child&rsquo;s burgeoning passions with the abundant resources of your community.</p>
                    <h2>Play</h2>
                    <p>The deepest learning, especially for children, comes when they are doing something they
                      enjoy, in the spirit of play. And when this play is unstructured and child-led, the learning that
                      results is richer and more meaningful.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Recent research by a team of psychologists at the University of
                      Colorado reveals the benefits of play-based learning. In their study, the researchers found that
                      the more opportunity children had for free, unstructured, unsupervised play time&ndash;as opposed
                      to organized play like sports and classes&mdash;the higher their &ldquo;Executive
                      Functioning&rdquo; skills were. The children who were given more time for free play were better
                      equipped to establish their own goals, be more self-directed, more organized, and more
                      self-regulating than children engaged in more structured, supervised activities.[3]</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Give your children the freedom to play. Make unstructured play time
                      the priority over classes and lessons. Let your child lead and be the director of her play while
                      you hold the space for this deep learning to occur.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Warmth</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Natural learning comes easily from a warm and inviting space. Keep
                      natural toys and materials, de-clutter, and incorporate homemade items into play-spaces
                      to&nbsp;create an enriching learning environment.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Consider donating half of your child&rsquo;s current toys to
                      simplify and calm their space. The fewer the toys, the more deeply they will play with those that
                      are left.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">For your remaining toys, select high-quality, non-commercial toys
                      made from natural materials like wood and wool. These natural toys trigger a child&rsquo;s
                      imagination in ways that manufactured plastic cannot.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">And think creatively about special &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for young
                      children. Playing with a ball of yarn or a basket of clothespins, while a grown-up watches nearby,
                      can be great fun for babies and toddlers. Fill your play-spaces with warmth by showcasing the
                      homemade. Drape a piece of string or yarn across a window or wall and clip your child&rsquo;s
                      artwork to it. Frame your child&rsquo;s art for all to admire. Sprinkle handmades into your
                      play-spaces, with a homemade pillows or a knitted blanket, adding warmth and inspiration to your
                      home.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Curiosity</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Spark your child&rsquo;s natural curiosity with baskets of books
                      scattered throughout your home. Gather &ldquo;coffee table books,&rdquo; and other large, colorful
                      books to include in your play-spaces for children to explore. Make tools for child-directed
                      learning readily available and accessible, like wooden blocks and letters, puzzles, microscopes
                      and magnifying glasses, dress-up clothes and play silks. Set up a book nook or a nature corner or
                      a music alcove.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Envision your home as an incubator of curiosity and imagination,
                      with nooks and crannies offering enjoyable spaces for learning and discovery.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Creativity</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Think of ways to cultivate creativity in your home. Prepare a
                      morning art table for your toddler or preschooler to stumble upon. Fill it with paper and crayons,
                      tape and glue, magazines to cut up, or different materials to explore.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">For older children, designate a space in your home as your constant
                      &ldquo;creativity corner,&rdquo; with art supplies ready and waiting when inspiration hits.
                      Filling our homes with creative spaces for our children help them to direct their own learning,
                      reveal their own interests, and pursue their own passions without waiting for grown-ups to lead
                      the way.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Rhythm</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">When we think of simple ways to integrate our children into the
                      daily rhythms of home&ndash;involving them in household projects, inviting them to move through
                      the day alongside us&ndash;we find that our days at home can be more peaceful, more enjoyable, and
                      more productive than we ever thought possible.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">
                      By re-envisioning our home and the daily tasks we complete within it as important to our
                      child&rsquo;s early learning and development, we begin to see that our role is not to entertain
                      our children, not to occupy them, but to welcome them into the daily rhythms of our life and work.
                      Yes, it will take longer&mdash;perhaps much longer&mdash;to fold that pile of clothes or bake
                      those cookies, but when we see our home-based activities&mdash;like cleaning and cooking&mdash;as
                      central to our child&rsquo;s learning, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it takes longer than it
                      otherwise would. It&rsquo;s not something to get through quickly so you can play with the train
                      set on the floor. Instead, it&nbsp; <em>is</em>&nbsp;the learning activity for that time of the
                      day, for that moment, and it is deeply worthwhile.
                    </p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Nourishment</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Just as folding the laundry can become a learning activity in and
                      of itself for young children&ndash;an exercise in sorting and organizing, identifying shapes and
                      colors in a natural way as part of the ordinary cadence of the day&mdash;so too can cooking and
                      baking.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Instead of feeling the need to buy play-dough, for instance, and
                      find a set time for using it with your toddler or preschooler, instead make basic pizza dough for
                      dinner. Mix some flour, water, yeast, and oil following a basic pizza dough recipe, and then let
                      your child play with it, roll it, knead it, squish it, while you move on to saut&eacute;ing your
                      mushrooms or preparing your salad. In this way, your child becomes actively involved in the daily
                      rhythms of home while engaged in age-appropriate play with homemade ingredients that will nourish
                      hungry bellies.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Playing with dough, then, becomes seamlessly integrated into your
                      day instead of an extra playtime activity. The same could be true of starting a simple herb garden
                      with your child, picking strawberries or applies, visiting farms and farmers&rsquo; markets,
                      making jam, or searching for wild edibles on a nature walk around town. All of these activities
                      are connected to your daily rhythms of feeding and caring for young children, and all present
                      extraordinary learning opportunities.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Ritual</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Children learn much through rituals. Different from routines that
                      are rigid and structured and automatic, rituals are fluid and evolving and designed to celebrate
                      daily, weekly, and seasonal moments. Enjoying a cup of tea every afternoon with your child.
                      Celebrating Friday nights with breakfast-for-dinner and a family movie. Welcoming the autumn
                      equinox with apple-picking and a harvest meal. These are all examples of rituals that you can
                      incorporate into your home life. They help children to mark the passing of time, to appreciate the
                      changing seasons and the natural cycle of the earth. They foster family togetherness and position
                      home as the central source for growth and discovery.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Nature</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Prioritizing nature, and integrating the natural world into your
                      everyday rhythms, can be an important way to spark natural learning with little ones. Take a daily
                      nature walk. Go puddle stomping. Jump in autumn leaves. Catch snowflakes. Create a seasonal nature
                      table, gathering items from your neighborhood to bring into your home and weave into your
                      child&rsquo;s play. Collect nature-based &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for your child, such as acorns and
                      tree bark, shells and rocks. These simple activities connect children to nature in important ways
                      and spark curiosity.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: start">Community</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Learning at home with little ones is not an isolated endeavor.
                      Build community by joining your local homeschooling network, most of which have designated play
                      dates or park days for preschool-age children.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">Seek community resources for learning, such as museums and
                      libraries, nature centers and farms, colleges and non-profits, local shops and community-based
                      organizations. Many of these community resources have classes for young children and all can serve
                      as helpful hubs for fostering natural learning.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: start">When we begin to see our home and our daily rhythms as an integral
                      part of our child&rsquo;s learning, the whole idea of living and learning at home with our little
                      ones becomes much less daunting. We spot simple ways to integrate our children into the daily
                      learning all around us, and provide the important conditions of freedom and play, warmth and
                      nourishment to make learning happen. We can live and learn joyfully with our children, using their
                      natural zest for discovery as our beacon.</p>
